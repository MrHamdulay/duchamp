The Duchamp Source Finder
-------------------------

Here's a brief guide to getting Duchamp up and running.

There is an executable (Duchamp) that has been compiled on a Debian
Linux kernel 2.6.8-2-686, with gcc version 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-13)

If that is no good to you, you can compile it yourself using the
Makefile included in this directory (sorry for not having a configure
script or similar yet!).

Duchamp uses three main external libraries: pgplot, cfitsio and
wcslib. You will need to set the paths for the base directory and
three libraries, as they are currently configured for my use and will
not be of much use to you! These are:

BASE --> the current directory
PGDIR --> where the pgplot libraries (and header files) are located
CFITSIODIR --> where the header file fitsio.h is
CFITSIOLDIR --> where the cfitsio library is located (libcfitsio.a)
WCSDIR --> where the wcslib header files are
WCSLDIR --> where the wcslib library is located (libwcs.a)

Once you've done that, then simply typing
> make duchamp
will compile the program.

To run it, you need to use the syntax
> Duchamp -p parameterFile
where parameterFile is a file with the input parameters, including the
name of the cube you want to search.

There are two example input files included with the distribution. The
smaller one, InputExample, shows the typical parameters one might want
to set. The large one, InputComplete, lists all parameters that can be
entered, and a brief description of them. Refer to the documentation
for further details.

To get going quickly, just replace the "your-file-here" in
InputExample with your image name, and type
> Duchamp -p InputExample
and you're off!

Any questions, please contact me!
