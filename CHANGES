Duchamp version 1.0.1 (2006/07/28)
----------------------------------

* A bug in the calculation of blank pixels has been fixed. The correct
  values from the FITS header were not propagating through correctly,
  meaning that the default values were being used.

* The zoomed spectrum had its flux scale determined by all points in the zoom box,
  including those flagged by the MW range. This has been fixed so that any MW 
  channels will not affect the flux scaling, potentially improving the appearance
  of objects detected close in velocity to strong MW emission or absorption.

* The position resolution in the IAU-format names has been increased, so that 
  distinct objects close to one another are more readily distinguished. 
  Overlapping sources at different velocities may still have the same name, but this
  is a more general problem.
