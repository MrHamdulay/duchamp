Duchamp version 1.0.2 (2006/08/22)
----------------------------------

* The FDR setup routine was occasionally failing with a segmentation
  fault, due to it accessing unallocated memory. This has been fixed. 

* A bug that affected the propagation of blank pixel information to
  various functions (such as drawMomentMap) was fixed. The moment maps
  should now be correct in all cases.

* Improved error and warning reporting, so that the formatting and
  presentation of information is clearer.

* Fixed bugs that affected the way 2D images (rather than 3D cubes)
  were dealt with. The minChannels test failed when minChannels=0.


Duchamp version 1.0.1 (2006/07/28)
----------------------------------

* A bug in the calculation of blank pixels has been fixed. The correct
  values from the FITS header were not propagating through correctly,
  meaning that the default values were being used.

* The zoomed spectrum had its flux scale determined by all points in
  the zoom box,including those flagged by the MW range. This has been
  fixed so that any MW channels will not affect the flux scaling,
  potentially improving the appearance of objects detected close in
  velocity to strong MW emission or absorption.

* The position resolution in the IAU-format names has been increased,
  so that distinct objects close to one another are more readily
  distinguished.  Overlapping sources at different velocities may
  still have the same name, but this is a more general problem.


Duchamp version 1.0 (2006/06/30)
--------------------------------

The first full release version.

Several major changes compared to previous version:

* Incorporated a FitsHeader class, to keep track of header information
  (including WCS) from the FITS file. All units-related calculations
  are done with this class, such as conversion to velocity, and
  pixel-to-WCS conversion.  The main advantage of this is improved
  speed of execution, more adaptable to different units, and improved
  code (easier for me!).

* Able to select the dimensionality of the reconstruction, rather than
  just doing it in 3-D.

* Robust text output, so that the columns are sized correctly given
  the data being written, and the relevant units (derived from the
  FITS header) are included in the output table.

* Improved the way the reconstructed image is saved and read back in,
  with a better naming scheme and a better set of new FITS header
  keywords. The MW headers are now not written.

Other, more minor changes include:

* MW channels now not set to 0, but just ignored for searching
  purposes (and for the scaling of the spectral output -- they are
  plotted though and highlighted with a hashed box).

* The scale bar in the moment map in the spectral output file has its
  length indicated.

* Improved VOTable output, with more information about the way Duchamp
  was run.

* Made sure all statistics calculations in the reconstruction are
  based on robust (ie. median) methods.

Also moved to an autoconf based configure/make compilation, for ease of use.


Duchamp version 0.9.2 (2006/06/27)
--------------------------------

* Added the use of warning flags for detections: for either edge
  location or negative enclosed flux.

* A new command line option added so that the user can specify a FITS
  file to be searched with the default parameters, rather than giving
  a full parameter file.

* The scale bar on the moment cutout now works in general case, using
  an iterative process to get to the correct length.

* RA axes are now done correctly on the full-scale maps.

* Various coding fixes, improving the readability of the code,
  particularly regarding the declaration of temporary variables.

* Changed the way the time of execution is called : now using time.h
  functions, rather than a system call.

* Changed output in Detection/outputDetection.cc for the pixel
  information of detected objects (the info printed above the spectral
  plots) -- now print out number of voxels in object, and have
  improved the formatting a little.

* Improved the functionality of saving the FITS file containing the
  reconstructed array. Added ability to save and read back in the MW
  parameters when saving a reconstructed cube (if a reconstructed cube
  has different MW range to that being considered, it would cause
  problems). ReadRecon now just returns a FAILURE and will reconstruct
  the cube anew.

* Changed default value of flagGrowth to 0. 



Duchamp version 0.9 (2006/05/05)
--------------------------------

First public release version.
