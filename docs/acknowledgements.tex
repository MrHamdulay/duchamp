\secA{Acknowledgements}

Thanks are due to the many people who have provided assistance and
advice during the development and testing of \duchamp, particularly
Ivy Wong, Kathrin Wolfinger, Tobias Westmeier, Mary Putman, Cormac
Purcell, Attila Popping, Tara Murphy, Enno Middelberg, Korinne
McDonnell, Malte Marquarding, Philip Lah, Russell Jurek, Simon Guest,
Jose Francisco Gomez, BiQing For, Luca Cortese, Mark Calabretta, David
Barnes and Robbie Auld. Additionally, Emil Lenc and Anita Richards
both provided valuable comments on the journal paper that have helped
the descriptions therein. I'd like to thank the members of the ASKAP
Working Group 2 (Source Finding) for their interest and feedback -
\duchamp has been considered as part of the development of ASKAP
Survey Science Projects, and this has driven further development of
the core \duchamp software.

The graphics in \duchamp are created using the
\textsc{pgplot}\footnote{http://www.astro.caltech.edu/$\sim$tjp/pgplot/}
library, FITS file access is controlled through the
\textsc{cfitsio}\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html}
library \citep{pence99}, while the world-coordinate transformations
are performed using the
\textsc{wcslib}\footnote{http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/index.html}
library (described in \citet{calabretta02}).

The bulk of this work was conducted as part of a CSIRO Emerging
Science Postdoctoral Fellowship, and \duchamp continues to be
maintained both as a standalone package and as part of the software
development effort for the ASKAP telescope. This work was supported by
the NCI National Facility at the ANU.
