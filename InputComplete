# GENERAL DETECTION RELATED
# flagStatSec -- Whether to only use a subsection of the cube to calculate 
#                the statistics.
# StatSec -- The subsection used for statistics calculations. It has the 
#            same format as the pixel subsection.
# flagRobustStats -- Shall we use robust statistics to characterise
#                    the noise in the image?
# flagNegative -- Are the features being searched for negative (set to true) 
#                 or positive (false -- the default)?
# snrCut --  How many sigma above mean is a detection when sigma-clipping
# threshold -- The threshold flux dividing source and non-source. Used instead 
#              of calculating it from the cube's statistics. If not specified,
#              it will be calculated.
# flagGrowth -- Should the detections be "grown" to a lower significance value?
# growthCut -- The lower threshold used when growing detections

#              reconstruction
# scaleMax -- The maximum scale to be included in the reconstruction. If it 
#              is <=0 then the maximum scale is calculated from the size of 
#              the array being reconstructed.
# snrRecon -- The threshold used in filtering the wavelet coefficient arrays.
# filterCode -- The code number for the choice of filter to be used in the 
#               reconstruction:  1 = B3-spline filter, 2 = Triangle function, 
#                                3 = Haar wavelet. Other numbers default to 2.
