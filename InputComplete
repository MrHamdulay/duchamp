#            same format as the pixel subsection.
# flagRobustStats -- Shall we use robust statistics to characterise
#                    the noise in the image?
# flagNegative -- Are the features being searched for negative (set to true) 
#                 or positive (false -- the default)?
# snrCut --  How many sigma above mean is a detection when sigma-clipping
# threshold -- The threshold flux dividing source and non-source. Used instead 
#              of calculating it from the cube's statistics. If not specified,
#              it will be calculated.
# flagGrowth -- Should the detections be "grown" to a lower significance value?
# growthCut -- The lower threshold used when growing detections
# growthThreshold -- The lower threshold, used in conjunction with "threshold"
# beamarea -- the area of the beam in pixels (equivalent to the old beamsize 
#             parameter). This value is overridden by the BMAJ, BMIN, BPA header 
#             parameters if present.
# beamFWHM -- the full-width at half-maximum of the beam, in pixels. Where given,
#             it overrides beamarea, but is overridden by the BMAJ, BMIN, BPA
#             headers.
# searchType -- how the searching is done. Either "spatial", where each 2D map is 
#               searched then detections combined, or "spectral", where each 1D 
#               spectrum is searched then detections combined.

#              reconstruction
# scaleMax -- The maximum scale to be included in the reconstruction. If it

#              the array being reconstructed.
# snrRecon -- The threshold used in filtering the wavelet coefficient arrays.
# filterCode -- The code number for the choice of filter to be used in the 
#               reconstruction:  1 = B3-spline filter, 2 = Triangle function,
